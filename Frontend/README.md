# Supply Chain Management Dashboard

This project is designed as a Supply Chain Management Dashboard, built from scratch using React, and it provides powerful tools for managing data in a supply chain environment.

## Project Overview

The application provides an interactive user interface that helps streamline supply chain processes. It includes data visualization, analytics, and seamless integration with backend APIs. The project was developed with scalability and user experience in mind.

## How to Run the Project

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

This will launch the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.\
The app will automatically reload when any changes are saved, and potential errors or warnings will be shown in the console.

### `npm test`

This script starts the test runner, which watches for code changes and reruns relevant tests. The tests are designed to ensure consistent quality and stability as the project evolves.

### `npm run build`

Creates an optimized production build of the app, ready for deployment. The production version is minified, and filenames are automatically hashed for caching purposes. The build is placed inside the `build` directory, ready for deployment on any hosting platform.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: Use with caution!** This is a one-way operation that extracts all the build configurations and dependencies into the project directory, allowing for full customization of the build process. Once done, you cannot revert this action.

## Custom Features

- **Custom Visualization Components:** We built our own data visualization components to provide unique insights into supply chain operations.
- **Optimized for Performance:** Each feature of the dashboard is optimized to load quickly and efficiently, even with large data sets.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive and works well on a variety of devices, from desktop to mobile.

## Deployment

Once the app is built, it can be deployed on any web server. For further information on deploying React apps, visit the official [React Deployment Guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-build.html).
